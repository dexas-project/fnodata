# fnodata

[![ISC License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)](http://copyfree.org)

fnodata is an original [Fonero](https://www.fonero.org/) block explorer, with
packages and apps for data collection, presentation, and storage. The backend
and middleware are written in Go. On the front end, Webpack enables the use of
modern javascript features, as well as SCSS for styling.

## Requirements

- [Go](http://golang.org) 1.11.6+ or 1.12.1+.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 10.x or 11.x. Node.js is only used
  as a build tool, and is **not used at runtime**.
- Running `fnod` running with `--txindex --addrindex`, and synchronized to the
  current best block on the network. On startup, fnodata will verify that the
  fnod version is compatible. fnodata v3.1.x and later required fnod v1.4.x or a
  later version with JSON-RPC server version 5.x.y.
- (For "full" mode) PostgreSQL 10.5+. Version 11.x is supported and recommended
  for improved performance with a number of tasks.

## Docker Support

Dockerfiles are provided for convenience, but NOT SUPPORTED. See [the Docker
documentation](docs/docker.md) for more information. The supported fnodata build
instructions are described below.

## Building

The fnodata build process comprises two general steps:

1. Bundle the static web page assets with Webpack (via the `npm` tool).
2. Build the `fnodata` executable from the Go source files.

These steps are described in detail in the following sections.

NOTE: The following instructions assume a Unix-like shell (e.g. bash).

### Preparation

- [Install Go](http://golang.org/doc/install)

- Verify Go installation:

      go env GOROOT GOPATH

- Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is on your `$PATH`.

- Clone the fnodata repository. It is conventional to put it under `GOPATH`, but
  this is no longer necessary with go module. For example:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/fonero-project/fnodata $HOME/go-work/github/fonero-project/fnodata
  ```

- Install a C compiler. The sqlite driver uses cgo, which requires a C compiler
  (e.g. gcc) to compile the sources. On Windows this is easily handled with
  MSYS2 ([download](http://www.msys2.org/) and install MinGW-w64 gcc packages).

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), which is required to lint
  and package the static web assets.

Note that none of the above is required at runtime.

### Package the Static Web Assets

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), a JavaScript module bundler, is used to
compile and package the static assets in the `public` folder. Node.js' `npm`
tool is used to install the required Node.js dependencies and build the bundled
JavaScript distribution for deployment.

First, install the build dependencies:

```sh
npm install # creates node_modules folder
```

Then, for production, build the webpack bundle:

```sh
npm run build # creates public/dist folder
```

Alternatively, for development, `npm` can be made to watch for and integrate
JavaScript source changes:

```sh
npm run watch
```

See [Front End Development](#front-end-development) for more information.

### Building fnodata with Go

Go 1.11 introduced [modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), a new
dependency management approach, that obviates the need for third party tooling
such as `dep`.

Usage is simple and nothing is required except Go 1.11 or later. If building in
a folder under `GOPATH`, it is necessary to explicitly build with modules
enabled:

    GO111MODULE=on go build

If building outside of `GOPATH`, modules are automatically enabled, and `go
build` is sufficient.

The go tool will process the source code and automatically download
dependencies. If the dependencies are configured correctly, there will be no
modifications to the `go.mod` and `go.sum` files.

**Beware:** For the v4 fnodata module, the executable generated by `go build`
may be named "v4" instead of "fnodata". This
is a [known issue in Go 1.11](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/27283) that
will be [resolved in a future Go release](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/140863/).

As a reward for reading this far, you may use the [build.sh](dev/build.sh)
script to mostly automate the build steps.

### Setting build version flags

By default, the version string will be postfixed with "-pre+dev".  For example,
`fnodata version 4.0.0-pre+dev (Go version go1.12.1)`.  However, it may be
desirable to set the "pre" and "dev" values to different strings, such as
"beta" or the actual commit hash.  To set these values, build with the
`-ldflags` switch as follows:

```sh
GO111MODULE=on go build -o fnodata -v -ldflags \
    "-X github.com/fonero-project/fnodata/version.appPreRelease=beta \
     -X github.com/fonero-project/fnodata/version.appBuild=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`"
```

This produces a string like `fnodata version 4.0.0-beta+25777e23 (Go version go1.12.1)`.

### Runtime Resources

The config file, logs, and data files are stored in the application data folder,
which may be specified via the `-A/--appdata` and `-b/--datadir` settings.
However, the location of the config file may also be set with `-C/--configfile`.
The default paths for your system are shown in the `--help` description.
If encountering errors involving file system paths, check the permissions on these
folders to ensure that _the user running fnodata_ is able to access these paths.

The "public" and "views" folders _must_ be in the same folder as the `fnodata`
executable. Set read-only permissions as appropriate.

## Updating

Update the repository (assuming you have `master` checked out in `GOPATH`):

```sh
cd $HOME/go-work/github/fonero-project/fnodata
git pull origin master
```

Look carefully for errors with `git pull`, and reset locally modified files if
necessary.

Next, build `fnodata` and bundle the web assets:

```sh
go build
npm install
npm run build # or npm run watch
```

Note that performing the above commands within `$GOPATH` may require setting
`GO111MODULE=on`.

## Upgrading Instructions

### From v3.x or later

No special actions are required. Simply start the new fnodata and automatic
database schema upgrades and table data patches will begin.

### From v2.x or earlier

The database scheme change from fnodata v2.x to v3.x does not permit an
automatic migration. The tables must be rebuilt from scratch:

1. Drop the old fnodata database, and create a new empty fnodata database.

   ```sql
   -- Drop the old database.
   DROP DATABASE fnodata;

   -- Create a new database with the same "pguser" set in the fnodata.conf.
   CREATE DATABASE fnodata OWNER fnodata;
   ```

2. Delete the fnodata data folder (i.e. corresponding to the `datadir` setting).
   By default, `datadir` is in `{appdata}/data`:

   - Linux: `~/.fnodata/data`
   - Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/Fnodata/data`
   - Windows: `C:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Local\Fnodata\data` (`%localappdata%\Fnodata\data`)

3. With fnod synchronized to the network's best block, start fnodata to begin
   the initial block data sync.

## Getting Started

### Configuring PostgreSQL (**IMPORTANT!** Seriously, read this.)

If you intend to run fnodata in "full" mode (i.e. with the `--pg` switch), which
uses a PostgreSQL database backend, it is crucial that you configure your
PostgreSQL server for your hardware and the fnodata workload.

Read [postgresql-tuning.conf](./db/fnopg/postgresql-tuning.conf) carefully for
details on how to make the necessary changes to your system. A helpful online
tool for determining good settings for your system is called
[PGTune](https://pgtune.leopard.in.ua/). Note that when using this tool to
subtract 1.5-2GB from your system RAM so fnodata itself will have plenty of
memory. **DO NOT** simply use this file in place of your existing
postgresql.conf. **DO NOT** simply copy and paste these settings into the
existing postgresql.conf. It is necessary to *edit the existing
postgresql.conf*, reviewing all the settings to ensure the same configuration
parameters are not set in two different places in the file (postgres will not
complain).

On Linux, you may wish to use a unix domain socket instead of a TCP connection.
The path to the socket depends on the system, but it is commonly
`/var/run/postgresql`. Just set this path in `pghost`.

### Creating the fnodata Configuration File

Begin with the sample configuration file. With the default `appdata` directory
for the current user on Linux:

```sh
cp sample-fnodata.conf ~/.fnodata/fnodata.conf
```

Then edit fnodata.conf with your fnod RPC settings. See the output of `fnodata
--help` for a list of all options and their default values.

### Using Environment Variables for Configuration

Almost all configuration items are available to set via environment variables.
See the config.go file and the `config struct` for a complete list of which
settings may be set via environment variables. Each setting uses the `env`
struct field tag to specify the name of the environment variable (i.e.
`env:"FNODATA_USE_TESTNET"`).

Setting precedence:

1. Command line flags
2. Config file settings
3. Environment variables
4. Defaults defined in config.go

In general, boolean-typed variables will contain `USE`, `ENABLE`, or `DISABLE`
in the name.

For a list of the recognized environment variables, run `fnodata --help`.

### Indexing the Blockchain

If fnodata has not previously been run with the PostgreSQL database backend, it
is necessary to perform a bulk import of blockchain data and generate table
indexes. _This will be done automatically by `fnodata`_ on a fresh startup.

Note that fnodata requires that
[fnod](https://docs.fonero.org/getting-started/user-guides/fnod-setup/) is
running with some optional indexes enabled. By default, these indexes are not
turned on when fnod is installed. To enable them, set the following in
fnod.conf:

```ini
txindex=1
addrindex=1
```

If these parameters are not set, fnodata will be unable to retrieve transaction
details and perform address searches, and will exit with an error mentioning
these indexes.

### Starting fnodata

Launch the fnodata daemon and allow the databases to process new blocks.
Concurrent synchronization of both SQLite and PostgreSQL databases is performed,
typically requiring between 1.5 to 8 hours. See [System Hardware
Requirements](#System-Hardware-Requirements) for more information. Please reread
[Configuring PostgreSQL (**IMPORTANT!** Seriously, read
this.)](#configuring-postgresql-important-seriously-read-this) of you have
performance issues.

On subsequent launches, only blocks new to fnodata are processed.

```sh
./fnodata    # don't forget to configure fnodata.conf in the appdata folder!
```

Unlike fnodata.conf, which must be placed in the `appdata` folder or explicitly
set with `-C`, the "public" and "views" folders _must_ be in the same folder as
the `fnodata` executable.

### Hiding the PostgreSQL db Configuration settings.

By default postgres configuration settings are logged on system start up.
`--hidepgconfig` flag blocks the logging on fnodata start up.

### Running the Web Interface During Synchronization

By default, on fnodata startup, a syncing status page is the only page available
until sync is completed.

However, most of the explorer pages can be made available via the
`sync-status-limit` setting, which indicates a threshold on the number of blocks
yet to sync, below which the entire explorer will be made available. When set
with a value on the range `[2,5000]`, all fnodata pages will be active on
startup if the number of remaining blocks to process are less than the specified
value.

For example, if `sync-status-limit` is set to 1000, all fnodata pages will be
active when fewer than 1000 blocks remain to be processed, otherwise only the
sync status page will be accessible until synchronization is complete.

If `sync-status-limit` is not set (the default), only the sync status page will
be available (recommended).

```ini
sync-status-limit=1000
```

_It is recommended that you avoid setting `sync-status-limit` as a value larger
than 1000 especially if your machine struggles handling fnodata normal load.
Setting a larger value might worsen your situation especially when you try to
load processor intensive pages like ticketpool._

## System Hardware Requirements

The time required to sync varies greatly with system hardware and software
configuration. The most important factor is the storage medium on the database
machine. An SSD (preferably NVMe, not SATA) is strongly recommended if you value
your time and system performance.

### fnodata only (PostgreSQL on other host)

Minimum:

- 1 CPU core
- 2 GB RAM
- HDD with 4GB free space

### fnodata and PostgreSQL on same host

These specifications assume fnodata and postgres are running on the same machine.

Minimum:

- 2 CPU core
- 6 GB RAM
- HDD with 60GB free space

Recommend:

- 2+ CPU cores
- 8+ GB RAM
- SSD (NVMe preferred) with 60 GB free space


## fnodata Daemon

The root of the repository is the `main` package for the `fnodata` app, which
has several components including:

1. Block explorer (web interface).
2. Blockchain monitoring and data collection.
3. Mempool monitoring and reporting.
4. Database backend interfaces.
5. RESTful JSON API (custom and Insight) over HTTP(S).
6. Websocket-based pub-sub server.
7. Exchange rate bot and gRPC server.

### Block Explorer

After fnodata syncs with the blockchain server via RPC, by default it will begin
listening for HTTP connections on `http://127.0.0.1:7777/`. This means it starts
a web server listening on IPv4 localhost, port 7777. Both the interface and port
are configurable. The block explorer and the JSON APIs are both provided by the
server on this port.

Note that while fnodata can be started with HTTPS support, it is recommended to
employ a reverse proxy such as Nginx ("engine x"). See sample-nginx.conf for an
example Nginx configuration.

## APIs

The fnodata block explorer is exposed by two APIs: a Fonero implementation of
the [Insight API](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api), and its
own JSON HTTP API. The Insight API uses the path prefix `/insight/api`. The
fnodata API uses the path prefix `/api`.
File downloads are served from the `/download` path.

### Insight API

The [Insight API](https://github.com/bitpay/insight-api) is accessible via HTTP
via REST or WebSocket.

See the [Insight API documentation](api/Insight_API_documentation.md) for
further details.

### fnodata API

The fnodata API is a REST API accessible via HTTP. To call the fnodata API, use
the `/api` path prefix.

The full ticket pool endpoints accept the URL query `?sort=[true\|false]` for
requesting the tickets array in lexicographical order. If a sorted list or list
with deterministic order is _not_ required, using `sort=false` will reduce
server load and latency. However, be aware that the ticket order will be random,
and will change each time the tickets are requested.

<sup>\*</sup>For the pool info block range endpoint that accepts the `arrays`
url query, a value of `true` will put all pool values and pool sizes into
separate arrays, rather than having a single array of pool info JSON objects.
This may make parsing more efficient for the client.

Exchange monitoring is off by default. Server must be started with
`--exchange-monitor` to enable exchange data.
The server will set a default currency code. To use a different code, pass URL
parameter `?code=[code]`. For example, `/exchanges?code=EUR`.

| Endpoint list (always indented) | `/list`   | `[]string`         |

All JSON endpoints accept the URL query `indent=[true|false]`. For example,
`/stake/diff?indent=true`. By default, indentation is off. The characters to use
for indentation may be specified with the `indentjson` string configuration
option.

## Important Note About Mempool

Although there is mempool data collection and serving, it is **very important**
to keep in mind that the mempool in your node (fnod) is not likely to be exactly
the same as other nodes' mempool. Also, your mempool is cleared out when you
shutdown fnod. So, if you have recently (e.g. after the start of the current
ticket price window) started fnod, your mempool _will_ be missing transactions
that other nodes have.

## Command Line Utilities

### rebuilddb

`rebuilddb` is a CLI app that performs a full blockchain scan that fills past
block data into a SQLite database. This functionality is included in the startup
of the fnodata daemon, but may be called alone with rebuilddb.

### rebuilddb2

`rebuilddb2` is a CLI app used for maintenance of fnodata's `fnopg` database
(a.k.a. DB v2) that uses PostgreSQL to store a nearly complete record of the
Fonero blockchain data. This functionality is included in the startup of the
fnodata daemon, but may be called alone with rebuilddb2. See the
[README.md](./cmd/rebuilddb2/README.md) for `rebuilddb2` for important usage
information.

### scanblocks

scanblocks is a CLI app to scan the blockchain and save data into a JSON file.
More details are in [its own README](./cmd/scanblocks/README.md). The repository
also includes a shell script, jsonarray2csv.sh, to convert the result into a
comma-separated value (CSV) file. This app is not actively maintained.

## Front End Development

Make sure you have a recent version of [node and
npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. You may want to use the [node
version manager (nvm)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) for managing your node
download and installation.

From the fnodata root directory, run the following command to install the node
modules.

`npm install`

This will create and install into a directory named `node_modules`.

You'll also want to run `npm install` after merging changes from upstream. It is
run for you when you use the build script (`./dev/build.sh`).

For development, there's a webpack script that watches for file changes and
automatically bundles. To use it, run the following command in a separate
terminal and leave it running while you work. You'll only use this command if
you are editing javascript files.

`npm run watch`

For production, bundle assets via:

`npm run build`

Both the `watch` and `build` scripts create a single output file at
`/public/js/dist/app.bundle.js`. You will need to at least `build` if changes
have been made. `watch` essentially runs `build` after file changes, but also
performs some additional checks.

### CSS Guidelines

Webpack compiles SCSS to CSS while bundling. The `watch` script described above
also watches for changes in these files and performs linting to ensure [syntax
compliance](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard).

Before you write any CSS, see if you can achieve your goal by using existing
classes available in Bootstrap 4. This helps prevent our stylesheets from
getting bloated and makes it easier for things to work well across a wide range
browsers & devices. Please take the time to [Read the
docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)

Note there is a dark mode, so make sure things look good with the dark
background as well.

### HTML

The core functionality of fnodata is server-side rendered in Go and designed to
work well with javascript disabled. For users with javascript enabled,
[Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) creates a persistent
single page application that handles all HTML rendering.

.tmpl files are cached by the backend, and can be reloaded via running
`killall -USR1 v4` from the command line.

### Javascript

To encourage code that is idiomatic to Turbolinks based execution environment,
javascript based enhancements should use [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/)
controllers with corresponding actions and targets. Keeping things tightly
scoped with controllers and modules helps to localize complexity and maintain a
clean application lifecycle. When using events handlers, bind and **unbind**
them in the `connect` and `disconnect` function of controllers which executes
when they get removed from the DOM.

### Web Performance

The core functionality of fnodata should perform well in low power device / high
latency scenarios (eg. a cheap smart phone with poor reception). This means that
heavy assets should be lazy loaded when they are actually needed. Simple tasks
like checking a transaction or address should have a very fast initial page
load.

## Helper Packages

`package dbtypes` defines the data types used by the DB backends to model the
block, transaction, and related blockchain data structures. Functions for
converting from standard Fonero data types (e.g. `wire.MsgBlock`) are also
provided.

`package rpcutils` includes helper functions for interacting with a
`rpcclient.Client`.

`package stakedb` defines the `StakeDatabase` and `ChainMonitor` types for
efficiently tracking live tickets, with the primary purpose of computing ticket
pool value quickly. It uses the `database.DB` type from
`github.com/fonero-project/fnod/database` with an ffldb storage backend from
`github.com/fonero-project/fnod/database/ffldb`. It also makes use of the `stake.Node`
type from `github.com/fonero-project/fnod/blockchain/stake`. The `ChainMonitor` type
handles connecting new blocks and chain reorganization in response to notifications
from fnod.

`package txhelpers` includes helper functions for working with the common types
`fnoutil.Tx`, `fnoutil.Block`, `chainhash.Hash`, and others.

## Internal-use Packages

Some packages are currently designed only for internal
use by other fnodata packages, but may be of general value in
the future.

`blockdata` defines:

- The `chainMonitor` type and its `BlockConnectedHandler()` method that handles
  block-connected notifications and triggers data collection and storage.
- The `BlockData` type and methods for converting to API types.
- The `blockDataCollector` type and its `Collect()` and `CollectHash()` methods
  that are called by the chain monitor when a new block is detected.
- The `BlockDataSaver` interface required by `chainMonitor` for storage of
  collected data.

`fnopg` defines:

- The `ChainDB` type, which is the primary exported type from `fnopg`, providing
  an interface for a PostgreSQL database.
- A large set of lower-level functions to perform a range of queries given a
  `*sql.DB` instance and various parameters.
- The internal package contains the raw SQL statements.

`fnosqlite` defines:

- A `sql.DB` wrapper type (`DB`) with the necessary SQLite queries for
  storage and retrieval of block and stake data.
- The `WiredDB` type, intended to satisfy the `DataSourceLite` interface used by
  the fnodata app's API. The block header is not stored in the DB, so a RPC
  client is used by `WiredDB` to get it on demand. `WiredDB` also includes
  methods to resync the database file.

`package mempool` defines a `MempoolMonitor` type that can monitor a node's
mempool using the `OnTxAccepted` notification handler to send newly received
transaction hashes via a designated channel. Ticket purchases (SSTx) are
triggers for mempool data collection, which is handled by the
`MempoolDataCollector` class, and data storage, which is handled by any number
of objects implementing the `MempoolDataSaver` interface.
